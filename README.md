# 🖐 Hand Sign Detection using OpenCV

This project is a beginner-friendly computer vision application that detects hand regions in real-time using a webcam. It helped me get hands-on with OpenCV, Matplotlib, and real-time image processing.

## 📌 Features

- Real-time hand detection using color masking
- Contour detection and bounding boxes
- Live webcam video feed processing
- Frame visualization using Matplotlib

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   -https://github.com/krishnasharma180/Hand_Sign_Detection.git
   -cd Hand-Sign-Detection

3. Run the project:
   python hand_detection.py

> Make sure your webcam is connected.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Basics of OpenCV (video capture, color spaces)
- Image masking and contour detection
- Real-time video handling and visualization
